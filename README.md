# A sample for Angular Material 5 Datepicker with DD/MM/YYYY format, and Monday as week start

It's a pretty much standard Angular app created by angular-cli, sporting some customisation for the Material Datepicker control.

Use standard npm & angular-cli commands to get all the dependencies, build & run this demo.
